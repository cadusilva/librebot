# Nitterbot
Basic bot that converts twitter links of any kind to nitter.net or similar

Requirements:
* Poetry
* .env file with login info 


## TODO
 *  write some tests
 * rewrite using the stream API to avoid persistence since we don't care about the past here, only the future!
    > Callbacks for the streaming API. Create a subclass, override the on_xxx methods for the kinds of events youâ€™re interested in, then pass an instance of your subclass to Mastodon.user_stream(), Mastodon.public_stream(), or Mastodon.hashtag_stream().
